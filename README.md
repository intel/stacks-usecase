## Intel System Stacks Usecases

[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)

The Clear Linux* OS  based [reference stacks](https://github.com/intel/stacks) allow developers to quickly get up and running with images tailored, optimized, and tested together for specific use cases. This repository offers example use cases to explore the possibilities.

The first End to End use case uses the [Data Analytics Reference Stack](https://clearlinux.org/stacks/data-analytics) and the [Deep Learning Reference Stack](https://clearlinux.org/stacks/deep-learning) to walk through a classification example, using data from GitHub* to show how Machine Learning can analyze and tag new issues to save time for developers who are creating issues, and to ensure the issues come to the attention of the right audience through correct tagging.

Look for more use cases to come soon.

## Security Issues

### Coding Styles

We love pep8 (except for the line length of 79, we deem a length of 90 is good), and use black to ensure that coding
style is consitent, please run `black xx.py` if you are making any change to python files.
